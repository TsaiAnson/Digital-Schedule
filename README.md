# Digital-Schedule
The Digital Schedule keeps track of all entries and properly notifies the User when the set time requirements are met. The program also allows the User to create contacts with names and phone numbers. For usability, the program includes a basic GUI interface. Written in Java.

#### Letâ€™s Get Started!
To compile, go into the Digital_Schedule folder and run in Terminal: `javac Contact.java Event.java ListNode.java ContactList.java EventList.java Diary.java DiaryGUI.java Startup.java`

To run the program, simply run `java Startup`

#### Home Screen
At the home screen, we are presented with three options: We can edit Events, our Contact List, and Exit the program. 
Note that if you Exit the program, the process will terminate and no notifications will be sent. 

#### Events
In the Events window, we are able to create, edit and remove Events. To create an Event, simply click on Add Event and follow the instructions. To edit an Event, select the desired even in the left menu and click on Edit Event. Similarly, to remove an Event select it in the menu and press Delete Event. 

#### Contacts
In the Contacts window, we can see that there are a few sample Contacts already populated (Feel free to remove them). The process of creating, editing, and removing contacts is the exact same as with Events so feel free to look above as a refresher.

#### Feedback!
How is my program? Do you have any questions, comments, and/or improvements? Feel free to let me know!
